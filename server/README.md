# GraphQL API 

To start app:

  * `brew install rethinkdb`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000/api) from a GraphiQL IDE 


## Notes

- app is named `Api`
- this is currently using Phoenix 1.2RC
- removed get text 
- removed views
- no brunch
- no ecto (in favor of RethinkDB)
