# Starter App

A very basic Phoenix API. Sets up RethinkDB and GraphQL with generic user type

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql) from your browser to view the GraphQL schema.
